The person behind the blog. 

I have been working with Computer Systems from a very young age. 
I was introduced to Basic Programming when I was 8 years old, and created my
first computer program by my self at the age of 9.

I like everything related to Security Systems and Computer Programming and to
build projects involving Networked Applications.
I have worked as a Security Analyst, Developer and as a System
Administrator. 

I&#39;m fluent in 8 Programming Languages but Assembly is my favorite.
