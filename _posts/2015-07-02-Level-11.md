This will be solution for Level 11  [Practical Web Hacking](http://ctf.infosecinstitute.com "Practical Web Hacking") CTF #2. 

This level we have to bypass a Blacklist, and is very similar to level 9 and level 5 in the way that is also [Session management](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet), as i explained in level 5.

So this one is just like the other two levels we need to find how the session stores that information and change it to something more convinent. 
in this case we their were not that much work to do the session toke name and its value gave it all away :)
