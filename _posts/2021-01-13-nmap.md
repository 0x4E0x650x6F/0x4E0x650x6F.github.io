## Effective Service Enumeration

In this post we will address one of the tasks that haunts every pentester or red team operator, **service enumeration**.
Its challenging task for every red team operator / pentester, specially when confronted with a  **Class A**
network address range for the first time.


**A typical service enumeration technique** is comprised of: 

- **Host discovery:** Create a list of live hosts (as close to 100%) as possible. 
- **Port Scanning:**  Find the exposed services on the hosts found by the previous step. 
- **Version Scan:** Determine software names and versions; this assists the operator in prioritizing what services to test first or to leave behind.  


When performing pentesting for a big corporations, pentesters usually face budget and time constraints on their analysis;
by contrast, threat actors often don't have these kind of limitations and can run more detailed analysis without any
time constraints, and consolidate more information during that time. The lack of time constraints also enable attackers
to use slower, less noisy analysis techniques, in an attempt to avoid detection. Regardless, service enumeration is used
at different stages (such as lateral movements and black box analysis), and often performed with tools like **nmap**,
**masscan**, **zmap**, to name a few. Our approach presented in this post relies on **nmap**, as we found it is quite
reliable in our usage scenarios. 

While asynchronous scanning is a hot topic, we found network latency can have a big impact on its reliability, considering
slow responses may lead to **false negatives**, showing ports that are actually open but slow as closed. As such, our
solution relies on synchronous scan, opting instead to distribute the task to multiple workers.


### Discovery 

Active discovery is usually the second step taken by operators. It revolves around the following steps: 

- Identify **dhcp** information;
- Where is the current host located in the network.
- What is the **ipaddress** of the host. 

Some of this information can be provided by the operating system, and other can be collected by listening to the network
with a specialized tool like netdiscovery. The **active discovery** is contextualized when an operator is able to determine 
the potential number of neighbours.
 
The address range and the latency of the network, as well as bandwidth and possible network filters can be critical to the
successful completion of this task. There are several common methods of discovery, such as:


#### DNS BASED

By analyzing the amount of internal names, we can try to establish a range of  addresses considering the **class** of 
address ranges for **Class A** or **class B**; This is commonly achieved by splitting the ranges in subtnets **/24**. 


#### Ping sweeps

There are many tools capable of performing ping sweeps, including nmap. Nmap uses it to create internal
statistics to aid its planing and prediction algorithms. However, in modern networks this might be a source of problems
due to icmp blocks or slowdowns that will impact the accuracy and time spent on each target. 

#### Port acknowledge 

By manually choosing common ports that systems often have open, such as 22 in Linux or 135 or 3389 in Windows, we can use
nmap to quickly identify possible alive hosts by focusing on these ports first. This results in shorter analysis time,
at the expense of some accuracy.

### Port Scanning

I read this once, "port scanning is the equivalent o geting into a building and knock on every door, to see who lives their", port scanning is the most common and well-known method, and the most common task for the usage of nmap. It involves
iterating every port (from all the possible 65536 ports) and check if it is reachable. It is the most extensive method,
but with longer execution time and generates more network traffic. A comprehensive pentest will  always include a 
full TCP/UDP scan, but not all companies perform network scans regularly.   

As most operators, we also experimented different approaches at automating these methods, using both available and
custom made tools and scripts. An approach we found particularly effective is to split ports and ip addresses in ranges,
(usually called "staged scan"), making them more manageable.

An example of this approach would be: 

```
80,443,8080
25,135,137,139,445,1433,3306,5432
23,21,22,110,111,2049,3389
0-20,24,26-79,81-109,112-134,136,138,140-442,444,446-1432,1434-2048,2050-3305, \
3307-3388,3390-5431,5433-8079,8081-29999
30000-65535
```    

The need to keep an eye on the scanner and make sure it wasn't stopped between stages led us to craft some automation
for this approach, called **[Dscan](https://github.com/0x4E0x650x6F/dscan "Distribuited Scan")**. Dscan centralizes the
results and status of a set of scanner workers (called agents), while allowing resume of scans. This alleviates the need of attention
from an operator, and it is particularly suited for regular scans, as they can take longer time and their state is managed
automatically.

### Dscan 

Dscan is a small distributed application, with two components **server** and **agent**. The components interact via TCP
with SSL. The server coordinates the execution of the agents that will perform the scan tasks, and aggregate the generated
results. The tool behaves well in multiple scenarios, ranging from dedicated servers to raspberry pi boxes, enabling
unattended scans on available networks.

The solution allows the configuration of any number of stages, requiring always at least one - the discovery stage. This
stage is used by the tool to enumerate live hosts and their addresses. These hosts are then grouped  in **cidr** or block range 
format.

Both server and agent keep a copy of the scan report. When an agent is disconnected, it is added to an internal unfinished pool.
If the server fails catastrophically, there is a .trace file that holds a serialized state of the scan process, 
allowing it to resume its previous state,  **including** unfinished or failed scans. 

##### Configuration

Configuration steps:
- generate a certificate and private key for your setup;
- copy the certificate file to the agents;
- edit the appropriate settings in the configuration file;

A configuration file example is shown below. The server can generate a boilerplate configuration file, suitable for most
tasks, and ready to be adjusted to a specific scenario.
