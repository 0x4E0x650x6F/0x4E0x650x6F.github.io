This will be solution for Level 7  [Practical Web Hacking](http://ctf.infosecinstitute.com "Practical Web Hacking") CTF #2. 

This level we have a simple login screen, the objective is to exploit a [A3 Cross-Site_Scripting](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A3-Cross-Site_Scripting_(XSS) "Cross-Site_Scripting"), this types of vulnerabilities exploit the interpreter in the browser to achieve client site code execution (Javascript). 

1. [session hijacking](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_hijacking_attack)
2. [Cross-Site Request Forgery](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)) 

The objective is to inset a html tag with our name in it, for that we need to see some details about the implementation.

After close inspection of the url we noticed that a script uses the **window.location.href**,
this lead to the idea that some of that information might be sent to server, for later use, in the attempt to verify this i noticed that
a hidden input field with the value of arguments sent in the query string. 

## Tasks:
1. break\ end the hidden tag.
2. Create tag with the required string.
3. Enjoy level 8 :)
